## Dataset

> The data consists of 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan including loan amount, borrower(interest) rate, current loan status, borrower income, and many others.

## Summary of Findings

During the investigation I noticed stronger correlations when I performing multivariate analysis.
Some strong influencing factors could be oobserved when plotting Loan Amount with loan grade and loan status.
I observed here that higher loan grades had higher default rates.

There was also a strong correlation between the loan amount and the loan purpose which also had a strong impact on the loan default rate for example when observing boat loans, there were lower defaulters at lower
loan amounts and higher defaulters at higher loan amounts.

There was also a trend between income range and loan amount where borrowers with higher income tend to take bigger loans.

Investigating the loan term and with the loan grade and loan status, I could see a trend where loans with
longer terms had higher default rate. This trend seems to persist across loan grades.


## Key Insights for Presentation

The presentation was mostly focused on variables what show strong impact on loan default rates.
Essentially observing the loan grade, loan amount and loan purpose and strong determinators
for loan default rate.
I used pie charts instead of bar plots for 2 value visualisations so as to clearly represent the
share each variable occupies in the dataset.
